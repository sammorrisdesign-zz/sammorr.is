Footage recorded in Chrome with [Nimbus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nimbus-screenshot-screen/bpconcjcammlapcogcnnelfmaeghhagj?hl=en) at 1280x720 viewport - set using the [window resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) extension.

Default settings for Nimbus: 1280x720, 1mbit/s, 15fps.

Nimbus exports a webm file that is converted to an mp4 using Adobe Media Encoder. Both formats are served to provide wider support.

The poster image is the first frame from the mp4. The mp4 can be opened in Photoshop and saved as a jpeg file.
